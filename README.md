Mood Bubbles

This app is intended for college students who feel alone in their feelings.
An anonymous user can comment something into the "void" and select a feeling.
Then the user is taken to a new page where they see bubbles corresponding to how many other people have selected the same feeling as you.

A functionality we haven't implemented yet is being able to select the bubbles and see various comments people made tagged with that feeling.
